# newsFeed
News feed project for fun, evolving into idk what but learning as we go.

## Summary
This is a project I started just to get back into coding more as I progress through my journey in tech. Nothing too serious here, just using HTML CSS JS to fetch data from newsapi.org and display it on a webpage. There are many professional sources of news, I'm not breaking any new ground here just improving my skills.
